# Solar-Tracker
In our project solar pannel will be powering the street lights.
To make solar pannel more efficient we have to adjust it in such a way that it absorbs maximum intensity of light. 
For doing that we are adusting a LDRs on the edges of the pannel and according to the light falling on ldr our solar tracker will move along with the sun direction with the help of servomotor.
In this way we can use the maximum intensity of sunlight fot the working of  the system.
